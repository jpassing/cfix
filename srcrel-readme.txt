CFIX SOURCE RELEASE README
--------------------------

N.B. The cfix source release is intended for debugging and reference purposes only. 

If, for any reason, the official builds should be insufficient for your
purposes and you intend to create a custom build of cfix, use the WDK
build utility to perform a build.
